In this section we will go over UBC's institutional data repository, Dataverse.

## Dataverse and FRDR

UBC provides researchers with two institutional data repositories: Dataverse and the Federal Research Data Repository (FRDR). We’re going to focus on Dataverse because this is the repository you will use to deposit your MGEM data. Just so you know, [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/) is a federated research data repository: it harvests datasets from other Canadian repositories (including Dataverse) and makes them available on a unified platform. We encourage you to check FRDR out and to watch its growth in the next few years because it will become an important source for data from Canadian researchers.

### Geodisy

As an added bonus, Evan is one of the people responsible for the development of [Geodisy](https://geo.frdr-dfdr.ca/), which is a geospatial data search layer built on top of Dataverse in collaboration with the FRDR organization. Adding geospatial metadata to your dataset in Dataverse will help Geodisy situate your data in its geospatial index.

[UBC’s Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/) is hosted by [Scholars Portal](https://scholarsportal.info/), an academic research initiative based in Ontario. You can use your UBC CWL to [log in](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/loginpage.xhtml) to Dataverse. Once you’ve logged in, navigate to the Faculty of Forestry dataverse and then to the MGEM dataverse; or go to the direct link: **[https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/UBC_MGEM](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/UBC_MGEM)**.

## Workflow for depositing into Dataverse

François’ handout tells you all about the nuts and bolts of depositing your MGEM capstone project. My demo will take you through a deposit on the Dataverse demo platform, so you can see how it works, and to give you some pointers. Here are the things you must do, and some things we strongly recommend you do, roughly in the order in which you will need to do them:

_1_{: .circle .circle-blue} Get yourself an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/). This is a good move to make, early in your career, because it will help you connect things like grants, research data and publications. It’s also one of the main ways that search engines such as Google link your work back to you.

_2_{: .circle .circle-blue} Organize your data on your local computer. Create a directory for your data deposit. Create a sub-directory for each main type of data you’re going to deposit. I’ve created directories for data and for scripts, for my demo.

_3_{: .circle .circle-blue} Check out our [guidance on creating README files](https://researchdata-06oct2014.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2020/04/QuickGuide_UBC_readme_v1.0_20200427.pdf). Have a look at [the Cornell site for creating READMEs)[https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme]; you can download their template README file and work from it. That’s what I did for today’s demo. I’ll explain why you will put a lot of the same metadata in your README file and in Dataverse.

_4_{: .circle .circle-blue} Think of a title and a description for your dataset. You could probably use the same ones as in your final report.

_5_{: .circle .circle-blue} Drawing on your description, think about some keywords to apply to your dataset. These will help other researchers find your data in web-scale search engines. Specialized vocabularies are good sources of keywords. Two that might help you out are the [CAB Direct](https://resources.library.ubc.ca/page.php?details=cab-direct&id=107) and [National Agricultural Library](https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/thesaurus-search) thesauri. I’ll talk about why they’re useful in my demo.

_6_{: .circle .circle-blue} There are lots of metadata elements in Dataverse but not all of them will apply to your dataset. For each element, ask yourself if it applies to your data. Hover over the question mark to read the guidance about that element. If it does, try and fill it in. Time spent on your metadata now equals better findability and a better chance that someone else will retrieve and use your data in the future.

_7_{: .circle .circle-blue} Deposit a PDF of your final report. PDFs follow ISO 32000-1:2008, which means they are not proprietary and are expected to be durable as files for the future.

_8_{: .circle .circle-blue} Be consistent in your date formatting. We suggest using the format YYYY-MM-DD, which complies with ISO 8601.
