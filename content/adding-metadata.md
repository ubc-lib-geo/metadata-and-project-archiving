In this section we will go over how to add and edit your metadata in ArcGIS Pro

# Adding metadata

Your data may not have any existing metadata descriptions for the fields that appear in your metadata editor. That's because either your data did not come with any metadata (if you're using data from an external source), or you have not included it for the data that you created. Here we will add content to appropriate metadata fields, and provide some explanation on what kinds if information should exist in each ISO 19115/19139 metadata field.

# Editing metadata field values

If you've already included metadata for your dataset, or if you've imported existing metadata for the data you're using, then you may already have information about your data. If so, you can manually edit your data, or update the existing metadata to include changes you've made to the data since the last time the metadata was updated.
